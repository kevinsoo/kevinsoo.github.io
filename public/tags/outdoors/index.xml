      <description>I love exploring the National Parks. Different parks contain different collections of hikes. I typically choose which park to visit based on a combination of sights I want to see and logistical constraints (e.g., travel time, cost, availability of campsites).
Once I’ve chosen a park to visit, I choose a set of trails to hike based on how much time/fitness I have (choosing hikes with distance and elevation gain within a certain range), with the goal of fitting in as many hikes as possible during my stay.</description>

      <description>Last year, the National Park Service celebrated its 100th anniversary. I’ve had the privilege to camp at several of them in the last few years (you can see photos I’ve taken on some of my travels here), and I’ll be going to Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado this Summer.
Growing popularity I think the National Parks are the greatest thing America has to offer. It seems many people agree – visitation has never been higher.</description>
