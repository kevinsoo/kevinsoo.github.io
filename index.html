							<h2>Research interests</h2>

							<h4>Causal cognition</h4>
							<p>I'm interested in how people think about causation. My research has investigated how people learn about causal direction (e.g., given two related variables, X and Y, is X or Y the cause?) and causal strength (e.g., how strong is the influence of a drug?). In particular, I investigate how people acquire such knowledge in light of beliefs about the way causal processes unfold over time. I'm also interested in the application of this research in applied contexts; e.g. understanding how patients and doctors understand the effects of drugs, and how this affects adherence.</p>

							<h4>Decisions from experience</h4>
							<p>Another thread of my work investigates how people evaluate options in the world based on past experience when making decisions. What strategies do we use to search for information prior to making a decision? Do our beliefs about the structure of the environment (e.g., the presence of temporal trends) influence our strategies? How do our (skewed) perceptions of outcomes and probabilities influence choice behavior?</p>

								<div id="journalabstract1" class="well well-sm collapse">One challenge when inferring the strength of cause-effect relations from time series data is that the cause and/or effect can exhibit temporal trends. If temporal trends are not accounted for, a learner could infer that a causal relation exists when it does not, or even infer that there is a positive causal relation when the relation is negative, or vice versa. We propose that learners use a simple heuristic to control for temporal trends – that they focus not on the states of the cause and effect at a given instant, but on how the cause and effect change from one observation to the next, which we call transitions. Six experiments were conducted to understand how people infer causal strength from time series data. We found that participants indeed use transitions in addition to states, which helps them to reach more accurate causal judgments (Experiments 1A and 1B). Participants use transitions more when the stimuli are presented in a naturalistic visual format than a numerical format (Experiment 2), and the effect of transitions is not driven by primacy or recency effects (Experiment 3). Finally, we found that participants primarily use the direction in which variables change rather than the magnitude of the change for estimating causal strength (Experiments 4 and 5). Collectively, these studies provide evidence that people often use a simple yet effective heuristic for inferring causal strength from time series data.

								<div id="journalabstract2" class="well well-sm collapse">The current research investigates how people decide which of two options produces a better reward by repeatedly sampling from the options. In particular, it investigates the roles of two features of search, optional stopping and switch rate, on participants’ final judgments of which option is better. First, in two studies, we found evidence for a new optional stopping effect; when participants stopped sampling right after experiencing a rare outcome, they made decisions as if they overweighted the rare outcome. Second, we investigated an effect proposed by Hills and Hertwig (2010), that people who frequently switch between options when sampling are more likely to make decisions consistent with underweighting rare outcomes. We conducted a theoretical analysis examining how switch rate can influence underweighting, and how the type of decision problem moderates this effect. Informed by the theoretical analysis, we conducted four studies designed to test this effect with high power. None of the studies produced significant effects of switch rate. Lastly, the studies replicated a prior finding that optional stopping and switch rate are negatively correlated. In sum, this research elaborates a fuller understanding of the relation between search strategies (switch rate and optional stopping) on how people decide which option is better, and their tendency to over- vs. underweight rare outcomes.

								<div id="proceedingabstract3" class="well well-sm collapse">When estimating the strength of the relation between a cause (X) and effect (Y), there are two main statistical approaches that can be used. The first is using a simple correlation. The second approach, appropriate for situations in which the variables are observed unfolding over time, is to take a correlation of the change scores - whether the variables reliably change in the same or opposite direction. The main question of this manuscript is whether lay people use change scores for assessing causal strength in time series contexts. We found that subjects' causal strength judgments were better predicted by change scores than the simple correlation, and that use of change scores was facilitated by naturalistic stimuli. Further, people use a heuristic of simplifying the magnitudes of change scores into a binary code (increase vs. decrease). These findings help explain how people uncover true causal relations in complex time series contexts.</div>

								<div id="proceedingabstract2" class="well well-sm collapse">Much research on elemental causal learning has focused on how causal strength is learned from the states of variables. In longitudinal contexts, the way a cause and effect change over time can be informative of the underlying causal relationship. We propose a framework for inferring the causal strength from different observed transitions, and compare the predictions to existing models of causal induction. Subjects observe a cause and effect over time, updating their judgments of causal strength after observing different transitions. The results show that some transitions have an effect on causal strength judgments over and above states.</div>

								<div id="proceedingabstract1" class="well well-sm collapse">Previous work has found that one way people infer the direction of causal relationships involves identifying an asymmetry in how causes and effects change over time. In the current research we test the generalizability of this reasoning strategy in more complex environments involving ordinal and continuous variables and with noise. Participants were still able to use the strategy with ordinal and continuous variables. However, when noise made it difficult to identify the asymmetry participants were no longer able to infer the causal direction.</div>
